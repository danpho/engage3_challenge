Summary:

The analysis utilized data from "prices.csv" (12,315 price datasets), "auditors.csv" (8 auditors), and "stores.json" (28 datasets). The data is largely complete, except for the "Banner" feature, which has 804 missing values. However, some anomalies were observed in the given data.

After removing these anomalies, the analysis revealed that Northern California has the highest price index, while Kansas has the lowest. The price indices decrease in the following order: Northern California, New York, Texas, and Kansas. This indicates that price levels vary by region, functioning as a regional attribute.

The comparison of average prices per UPC by region and store shows that Walmart consistently offers the lowest prices for the same product (UPC) within the same region compared to other stores. This price difference likely stems from the pricing strategies and business goals of each store. Consequently, store-specific pricing is also a significant factor influencing the regional price index.

Overall, the regional price index and the comparison of store prices suggest that both regional and store factors impact price levels. This finding aligns with the theoretical model provided.
Performing the anomaly analysis was essential for obtaining accurate insights. It helps ensure data consistency and enhances the accuracy and reliability of the insights derived from the analysis.
